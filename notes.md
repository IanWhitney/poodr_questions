## Class Notes

Squint Test
  Looking for changes in shape and color. 

Inebriation Test
  Can you understand this code if you've never seen it before & you're buzzed

Give concepts names
  n == 0
  or
  no_bottles?

Really simple solutions and small steps lead to working code.
Big jumps in solution complexity can

Refactor Under Green
  Once a test passes, a test can never fail again 
  So if extracting, leave original code in place until swapping out.

Conditionals as style guide
  there are different ways of doing conditionals. A single approach team-wide can reduce confusion

Clarity over DRY, especially initially

Make a list of things you don't like.
Pick the easiest to fix

Look at a class. Can it be divided in two?
  - It's easier to put objects back together later than it is to take them apart later
  - Tiny objects without tests = pain

Extracting and defining resposibilities has value even if you abandon the result.
  - You've defined concepts that you didn't know existed.
